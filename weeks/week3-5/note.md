## Before we start

0. Why C? Why pointers?

> Heck, in 1900, Latin and Greek were required subjects in college, not because they served any purpose, but because they were sort of considered an obvious requirement for educated people. ... Are pointers and recursion the Latin and Greek of Computer Science?

1. What is a pointer?
    - Size of data type
    - Why is it useful?

> A rating system for C-programmers. The more indirect your pointers are (i.e. the more "*" before your variables), the higher your reputation will be. No-star C-programmers are virtually non-existent, as virtually all non-trivial programs require use of pointers. Most are one-star programmers. In the old times (well, I'm young, so these look like old times to me at least), one would occasionally find a piece of code done by a three-star programmer and shiver with awe.
>
> Some people even claimed they'd seen three-star code with function pointers involved, on more than one level of indirection. Sounded as real as UFOs to me.
>
> Just to be clear: Being called a ThreeStarProgrammer is usually not a compliment. [Three Star Programmer]

        [in, optional]      LPCSTR                lpApplicationName,
        [in, out, optional] LPSTR                 lpCommandLine,
        [in, optional]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpProcessAttributes,
        [in, optional]      LPSECURITY_ATTRIBUTES lpThreadAttributes,
        [in]                BOOL                  bInheritHandles,
        [in]                DWORD                 dwCreationFlags,
        [in, optional]      LPVOID                lpEnvironment,
        [in, optional]      LPCSTR                lpCurrentDirectory,
        [in]                LPSTARTUPINFOA        lpStartupInfo,
        [out]               LPPROCESS_INFORMATION lpProcessInformation
        );

        // Unix-like
        pid_t fork(void);
        // and exec family
        ```
    - Unix-like API vs. Windows API, and their design philosophy (quoted from [CS 110L: Safety in Systems Programming])
